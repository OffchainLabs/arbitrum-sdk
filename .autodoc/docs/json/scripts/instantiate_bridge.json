  "summary": "This file contains a function called `instantiateBridge` that instantiates a set of objects used to interact with the Arbitrum network. The function takes two optional parameters, `l1PkParam` and `l2PkParam`, which are private keys for the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks, respectively. If these parameters are not provided, the function looks for environment variables `ARB_KEY` and `ETH_KEY` to use as the private keys.\n\nThe function first checks that either `l1PkParam` or `ETH_KEY` and `l2PkParam` or `ARB_KEY` are provided. It then determines the network IDs for the L1 and L2 networks based on a command line argument or a default value. It checks that the L2 network ID is valid and that it corresponds to an L2 network. It then retrieves the L1 and L2 network objects from the `l1Networks` and `l2Networks` dictionaries, respectively.\n\nThe function then determines the RPC URLs for the L1 and L2 networks based on the network ID. It creates `JsonRpcProvider` objects for each network using these URLs. It creates `Wallet` objects for the L1 and L2 networks using the private keys or environment variables. It then creates instances of `Erc20Bridger`, `AdminErc20Bridger`, `EthBridger`, and `InboxTools` using the L2 network object and the L1 `Wallet` object.\n\nThe function returns an object containing the L1 and L2 network objects, the L1 and L2 `Wallet` objects, the `Erc20Bridger`, `AdminErc20Bridger`, `EthBridger`, and `InboxTools` instances.\n\nThis function is used to create a set of objects that can be used to interact with the Arbitrum network. These objects are used throughout the project to perform various tasks, such as bridging assets between the L1 and L2 networks, interacting with the Arbitrum inbox, and deploying contracts to the L2 network. The function provides a convenient way to create these objects with the correct configuration and dependencies. An example usage of this function might look like:\n\n```\nconst {\n  l1Network,\n  l2Network,\n  l1Signer,\n  l2Signer,\n  erc20Bridger,\n  ethBridger,\n  adminErc20Bridger,\n  inboxTools,\n} = instantiateBridge()\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file instantiates a bridge between two Ethereum networks and provides access to various bridging tools.\n\n2. What environment variables are required for this code to run?\n- This code requires the `ARB_KEY` and `ETH_KEY` environment variables to be set.\n\n3. What are the different Ethereum networks that this code supports?\n- This code supports various L1 and L2 networks, including the mainnet, Goerli testnet, and local testnets. The network ID can be specified as a command line argument."
