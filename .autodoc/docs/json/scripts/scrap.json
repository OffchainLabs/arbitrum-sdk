  "summary": "This code is a JavaScript file that is part of the arbitrum-sdk project. The purpose of this file is to provide a template for running asynchronous code. \n\nThe code starts with a license and copyright notice. It then sets the environment to Node.js and uses strict mode. \n\nThe main function of the code is an asynchronous function that is immediately invoked. This function is an anonymous function that does not take any arguments. It is defined using an arrow function and the async keyword. \n\nInside the function, there is a comment that says \"do stuff here\". This is where the user can add their own asynchronous code. The purpose of this template is to provide a structure for running asynchronous code. \n\nThe code is designed to be used with the instantiateBridge function, which is commented out. This function is likely defined in another file in the arbitrum-sdk project. The purpose of the instantiateBridge function is to create a bridge between two systems. \n\nTo use this code, the user would need to uncomment the instantiateBridge function and add their own asynchronous code inside the main function. They could then run the code using Node.js. \n\nHere is an example of how this code could be used:\n\n```\n// import instantiateBridge from './instantiate_bridge'\n\n(async () => {\n  const bridge = await instantiateBridge()\n  // do something with the bridge\n})()\n```\n\nIn this example, the user would import the instantiateBridge function from another file. They would then create a bridge using the function and do something with the bridge inside the main function. The code would be run using Node.js.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code is likely a placeholder or template for some asynchronous functionality that will be added later. It currently does not do anything useful.\n2. What is the significance of the commented out `instantiateBridge()` function call?\n   - The `instantiateBridge()` function is likely a key part of the functionality that will be added later. It is currently commented out, so it is not being used.\n3. Why is there a license header at the top of the file?\n   - The license header indicates that this code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. This means that anyone who wants to use or modify this code must comply with the terms of that license."
