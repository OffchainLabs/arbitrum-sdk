  "summary": "This file contains a set of functions that are used to set gateways for tokens on the Arbitrum network. The gateways are used to transfer tokens between the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks. \n\nThe `setStandardGateWays` function is used to set the standard gateways for a list of tokens. The `setArbCustomGateways` function is used to set the custom gateways for a list of tokens. Both functions call the `setGateWays` function, which is the main function that sets the gateways for the tokens. \n\nThe `setGateWays` function takes in a list of tokens, the type of gateway to set, and an optional list of override gateways. It then performs some sanity checks on the tokens to ensure that they are valid ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network. It then sets the gateways for the tokens on the Arbitrum network. \n\nThe `checkRetryableStatus` function is used to check the status of a retryable ticket. A retryable ticket is a mechanism used to transfer tokens between the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks. The function takes in the hash of the transaction that created the retryable ticket and checks the status of the ticket. \n\nThe functions in this file are used to set gateways for tokens on the Arbitrum network. They are part of the larger Arbitrum SDK project and are used to facilitate the transfer of tokens between the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks. \n\nExample usage: \n\n```\nconst tokens = ['0x123...', '0x456...']\nconst receipt = await setStandardGateWays(tokens)\nconsole.log(receipt)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file?\n- This file contains functions for setting gateways and checking retryable status for the arbitrum-sdk project.\n\n2. What external libraries does this file use?\n- This file imports `ContractReceipt` from `@ethersproject/contracts`, and `ERC20__factory` from `../src/lib/abi/factories/ERC20__factory`.\n\n3. What do the `setStandardGateWays`, `setArbCustomGateways`, and `setGateWays` functions do?\n- `setStandardGateWays` and `setArbCustomGateways` are helper functions that call `setGateWays` with the corresponding gateway type. `setGateWays` sets the gateways for a list of tokens on the L1 network, and returns a `ContractReceipt`."
