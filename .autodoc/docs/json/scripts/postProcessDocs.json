  "summary": "This code is a script that reads all markdown files in the `./docs` directory and its subdirectories, replaces any `<` and `>` characters with their HTML entity equivalents (`&lt;` and `&gt;`, respectively), and writes the modified contents back to the original file. This is done to prevent these characters from breaking the rendering of JSX code blocks in the documentation.\n\nThe script uses the `glob` package to find all files in the `./docs` directory and its subdirectories that have a `.md` extension and are not named `README`. It then loops through each file and reads its contents using the `readFile` function from the built-in `fs` module. If an error occurs during this process, it is logged to the console and the script moves on to the next file.\n\nIf the file is successfully read, the script replaces all `<` and `>` characters in the file's contents using the `replace` method of the `String` object. The modified contents are then written back to the original file using the `writeFile` function from the `fs` module. If an error occurs during this process, it is logged to the console.\n\nThis script is likely used as part of a larger project to ensure that the documentation for the project's code is properly rendered and displayed. By replacing `<` and `>` characters with their HTML entity equivalents, the script ensures that any JSX code blocks in the documentation are not broken by these characters. This can help to improve the readability and usability of the project's documentation. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n// Assuming the script is saved as `fix-md.js` in the root directory of the project\n// Run the script using Node.js\nnode fix-md.js\n```",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n- This code reads all files in the `./docs` directory that have a `.md` extension (excluding `README.md`), replaces `<` and `>` characters with their HTML entity equivalents, and writes the modified contents back to the original file.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses the `glob` and `fs` modules from Node.js.\n\n3. What potential issues or errors could arise from running this code?\n- If the `./docs` directory does not exist or is empty, the code will not modify any files. Additionally, if any of the files in the directory are not readable or writable, the code will throw an error. Finally, if any of the files contain characters that should not be modified (e.g. HTML tags), the replacement could cause unintended consequences."
