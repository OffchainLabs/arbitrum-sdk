  "summary": "This code is a Node.js script that checks the status of a retryable transaction on the Arbitrum network. The script imports a function called `checkRetryableStatus` from a file called `lib.js`, which is located in the same directory. \n\nThe script also imports a module called `getCLargs`, which is used to parse command line arguments. Specifically, the script expects a `--txid` argument to be passed in with the hash of the transaction to be checked. If this argument is not provided, the script will throw an error.\n\nOnce the `txid` is obtained from the command line arguments, the `checkRetryableStatus` function is called with the `txid` as an argument. This function returns a Promise that resolves if the transaction is confirmed as retryable, and rejects if it is not. If the Promise resolves, the script exits with a status code of 0 (success). If the Promise rejects, the error message is logged to the console and the script exits with a status code of 1 (failure).\n\nThis script is likely used as a utility for developers working with the Arbitrum network to check the status of retryable transactions. It can be run from the command line with the appropriate arguments to quickly determine whether a transaction is retryable or not.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code checks the retryable status of a given transaction ID.\n\n2. What is the expected input format for the transaction ID?\n- The transaction ID should be passed as a command line argument with the flag `--txid` followed by the ID in hexadecimal format.\n\n3. What is the expected output of this code?\n- If the transaction is retryable, the code will exit with a status code of 0. If not, it will exit with a status code of 1 and print an error message to the console."
