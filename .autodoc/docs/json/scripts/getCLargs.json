  "summary": "This code is a command line interface (CLI) tool that uses the yargs library to parse command line arguments and options. The purpose of this tool is to provide a way to interact with the Arbitrum network and perform various tasks such as querying transaction information or interacting with smart contracts.\n\nThe code imports the yargs library and uses it to define the available options for the CLI tool. The available options are `address`, `l1TokenAddress`, `txid`, and `networkID`. These options are defined with their respective types, which are `string` for `address`, `l1TokenAddress`, and `txid`, and `number` for `networkID`.\n\nThe `parseSync()` method is then called on the yargs object to parse the command line arguments and options. The resulting object is then exported as the default export of this module.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project by importing this module and using the exported object to perform various tasks related to the Arbitrum network. For example, if a user wants to query transaction information, they can run the CLI tool with the `txid` option set to the desired transaction ID. The resulting object can then be used to display the transaction information to the user.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n$ node cli.js --txid 0x123456789abcdef\n```\n\nThis will parse the `txid` option and return an object with the `txid` property set to `0x123456789abcdef`. This object can then be used to query the transaction information from the Arbitrum network.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a module that imports the `yargs` package and exports an object containing parsed command line arguments.\n\n2. What command line arguments does this code expect?\n- This code expects the following command line arguments: `address` (string), `l1TokenAddress` (string), `txid` (string), and `networkID` (number).\n\n3. What is the license for this code?\n- This code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0."
