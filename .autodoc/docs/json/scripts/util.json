  "summary": "The code above defines a function called `getPackagePath` that takes in a string parameter called `packageName`. The purpose of this function is to retrieve the path of a package's directory by using the `require.resolve` method to locate the package's `package.json` file and then returning the substring of the path up to the point where the `package.json` file is located. \n\nThis function is not exposed in the shared library of the arbitrum-sdk project, which means that it is not intended to be used by external users of the library. Instead, it is likely used internally within the project to retrieve the path of a package's directory for various purposes such as importing modules or accessing configuration files.\n\nHere is an example of how this function might be used within the larger project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { getPackagePath } from 'arbitrum-sdk'\n\nconst packageName = 'my-package'\nconst packagePath = getPackagePath(packageName)\n\n// use the packagePath to import a module from the package\nimport { myModule } from `${packagePath}/myModule`\n```\n\nIn this example, the `getPackagePath` function is used to retrieve the path of the `my-package` directory, which is then used to import a module called `myModule` from that package. By using this function, the project can ensure that the correct path is always used to access the package's files, regardless of the project's directory structure or the location of the package's `package.json` file.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this function?\n   - This function returns the path of a package's directory by resolving its package.json file.\n\n2. Why is this method not exposed in the shared library?\n   - This method is not exposed in the shared library to avoid breaking it due to a dependency needed in the library.\n\n3. What is the input parameter for this function?\n   - The input parameter for this function is a string representing the name of the package."
