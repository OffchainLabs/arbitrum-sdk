  "summary": "This code is part of the Arbitrum SDK and defines the structure and configuration of Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks, as well as their associated token and ETH bridges. The code exports interfaces for L1 and L2 networks, token bridges, and ETH bridges, along with predefined configurations for mainnet, Goerli testnet, and local networks.\n\nThe `L1Network` and `L2Network` interfaces define the properties of each network, such as chain ID, name, explorer URL, and partner chain IDs. The `TokenBridge` and `EthBridge` interfaces define the properties of the bridges, such as gateway router addresses and multicall addresses.\n\nThe `l1Networks` and `l2Networks` objects store predefined configurations for supported networks. The `getL1Network` and `getL2Network` functions return the network configuration based on the provided signer, provider, or chain ID.\n\nThe `addCustomNetwork` function allows users to add custom L1 and L2 networks to the SDK, while the `addDefaultLocalNetwork` function registers a custom network that matches the one created by a Nitro local node, which is useful for development purposes.\n\nHere's an example of how to add a custom network:\n\n```javascript\nimport { addCustomNetwork } from 'arbitrum-sdk';\n\naddCustomNetwork({\n  customL1Network: { /* L1 network configuration */ },\n  customL2Network: { /* L2 network configuration */ },\n});\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of how to get the L1 network configuration for a specific chain ID:\n\n```javascript\nimport { getL1Network } from 'arbitrum-sdk';\n\nconst l1Network = await getL1Network(1); // Mainnet\nconsole.log(l1Network.name); // \"Mainnet\"\n```\n\nOverall, this code is essential for managing network configurations and bridges in the Arbitrum SDK, enabling developers to interact with different networks and customize their configurations as needed.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `addCustomNetwork` function?**\n\n   The `addCustomNetwork` function allows users to add custom L1 and L2 networks to the existing list of networks. This is useful for integrating custom or private networks into the Arbitrum SDK.\n\n2. **How does the `getNetwork` function work?**\n\n   The `getNetwork` function takes a `signerOrProviderOrChainID` and a `layer` (1 or 2) as input and returns the corresponding L1 or L2 network object. It first determines the chainID, then checks if the network exists in the `l1Networks` or `l2Networks` objects, and returns the network object if found. If the network is not found, it throws an `ArbSdkError`.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `addDefaultLocalNetwork` function?**\n\n   The `addDefaultLocalNetwork` function registers a custom network that matches the one created by a Nitro local node. This is useful for development purposes when working with a local instance of the Arbitrum network."
