  "summary": "This code defines several interfaces and enums related to the Arbitrum SDK, which is a toolkit for building decentralized applications on the Arbitrum network. Specifically, the code defines the components of a \"submit retryable message\" and the different types of messages that can be sent between the L1 (Ethereum mainnet) and L2 (Arbitrum) networks.\n\nThe `RetryableMessageParams` interface defines the parameters that make up a retryable message, which is a type of transaction that can be retried if it fails due to network congestion or other issues. These parameters include the destination address for the L2 message, the call value in the L2 message, the value sent at L1, the maximum gas deducted from the L2 balance to cover the base submission fee, and other details related to gas fees and refunds.\n\nThe `InboxMessageKind` enum defines the different types of messages that can be sent between the L1 and L2 networks, including a `submitRetryableTx` message that corresponds to the `RetryableMessageParams` interface. The `L2ToL1MessageStatus` enum defines the different states that an outgoing message can be in, including `UNCONFIRMED`, `CONFIRMED`, and `EXECUTED`.\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of tools for developers building on the Arbitrum network to create and manage retryable transactions and other types of messages between the L1 and L2 networks. For example, a developer might use the `RetryableMessageParams` interface to define the parameters for a retryable transaction, and then use the `InboxMessageKind` enum to specify the type of message being sent. The `L2ToL1MessageStatus` enum could be used to track the status of outgoing messages and ensure that they are executed correctly.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `RetryableMessageParams` interface?\n   - The `RetryableMessageParams` interface defines the components of a submit retryable message that can be parsed from the events emitted from the Inbox.\n2. What are the different kinds of messages defined in the `InboxMessageKind` enum?\n   - The `InboxMessageKind` enum defines three different kinds of messages: `L1MessageType_submitRetryableTx`, `L1MessageType_ethDeposit`, and `L2MessageType_signedTx`.\n3. What are the different statuses defined in the `L2ToL1MessageStatus` enum?\n   - The `L2ToL1MessageStatus` enum defines three different statuses: `UNCONFIRMED`, `CONFIRMED`, and `EXECUTED`. These statuses represent the different stages of an outgoing message from L2 to L1."
