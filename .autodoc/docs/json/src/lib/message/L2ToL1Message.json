  "summary": "This code defines the `L2ToL1Message` class and its two subclasses, `L2ToL1MessageReader` and `L2ToL1MessageWriter`. These classes provide functionality for reading and writing L2-to-L1 messages, which are messages sent from an Arbitrum L2 chain to an Ethereum L1 chain. \n\nThe `L2ToL1Message` class provides base functionality for L2-to-L1 messages, including a method for getting event logs for L2-to-L1 transactions. The `L2ToL1MessageReader` class provides read-only access to L2-to-L1 messages, including methods for getting the status of a message and estimating the L1 block number in which the message will be available for execution. The `L2ToL1MessageWriter` class provides read and write access to L2-to-L1 messages, including a method for executing a message on L1.\n\nThe code also includes several helper functions and types, including a type for Signer or Provider, a type for L2-to-L1 transaction events, and functions for getting outbox proofs and waiting until a message is ready to execute.\n\nOverall, this code provides a useful set of tools for working with L2-to-L1 messages in the Arbitrum SDK. Developers can use these classes to read and write messages, get information about their status, and execute them on L1.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `L2ToL1Message` class and its subclasses?\n- The `L2ToL1Message` class and its subclasses provide functionality for L2->L1 messages, including reading and writing access, getting event logs, and executing the messages on L1.\n\n2. What is the difference between `L2ToL1MessageReader` and `L2ToL1MessageWriter`?\n- `L2ToL1MessageReader` provides read-only access for L2->L1 messages, while `L2ToL1MessageWriter` provides both read and write access.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `getL2ToL1Events` method?\n- The `getL2ToL1Events` method is used to fetch event logs for L2->L1 transactions that match the provided filters, including classic and nitro events."
