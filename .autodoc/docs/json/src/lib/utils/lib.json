  "summary": "This file contains utility functions that are used in the larger arbitrum-sdk project. The functions are exported and can be imported into other files in the project. \n\nThe `wait` function is a simple utility function that takes a number of milliseconds as an argument and returns a promise that resolves after that amount of time has passed. This function can be used to introduce delays in code execution.\n\nThe `getBaseFee` function takes a provider object as an argument and returns the base fee per gas for the latest block. It does this by calling the `getBlock` method on the provider object and extracting the `baseFeePerGas` property from the result. If the `baseFeePerGas` property is not defined, an `ArbSdkError` is thrown. This function can be used to get the base fee per gas for a given network.\n\nThe `getTransactionReceipt` function takes a provider object, a transaction hash, an optional number of confirmations, and an optional timeout as arguments. If either the `confirmations` or `timeout` argument is defined, the function waits for the transaction receipt using the `waitForTransaction` method on the provider object. If the receipt is not received within the specified timeout, the function returns null. If neither `confirmations` nor `timeout` is defined, the function simply fetches the transaction receipt using the `getTransactionReceipt` method on the provider object. This function can be used to get the transaction receipt for a given transaction hash.\n\nThe `isDefined` function is a type guard that takes a value as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the value is defined (i.e., not null or undefined). This function can be used to check whether a value is defined before using it in code.\n\nOverall, these utility functions provide useful functionality that can be used throughout the arbitrum-sdk project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `wait` function?\n- The `wait` function is a utility function that returns a promise that resolves after a specified number of milliseconds.\n\n2. What is the `getBaseFee` function doing?\n- The `getBaseFee` function takes a provider object as input and returns the base fee per gas for the latest block. If the base fee is not available, it throws an `ArbSdkError`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `isDefined` function?\n- The `isDefined` function is a type guard that checks if a value is not null or undefined, and returns a boolean indicating whether the value is defined or not. It takes a generic type `T` as input and returns a type predicate that asserts that a value is of type `T`."
